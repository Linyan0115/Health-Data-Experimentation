# Health-Data-Experimentation

This individual project is build on the UW-Madison Course: STAT424 Statistical Experient Design

## Overview

This project investigates how common lifestyle factors influence sleep quality in modern society. Using a 16-night self-experiment based on a 2⁴ full factorial design, I systematically examined the effects of room temperature, screen exposure before bedtime, bedtime, and light conditions during sleep on sleep performance.

Data were collected through two wearable sleep tracking devices combined with self-assessment scores to capture multi-dimensional indicators such as sleep duration, deep sleep ratio, and efficiency. Statistical analyses (including factorial ANOVA and interaction effect visualization) were conducted to identify the most significant factors affecting sleep quality. The findings provide a data-driven foundation for optimizing personal rest habits and may offer practical insights for individuals facing similar sleep challenges.
